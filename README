This is the source for the bitwardenjordan/selfsigned Dockerhub image.

Run this image, e.g.:

`docker run -v $(pwd):/mnt -it bitwardenjordan/selfsigned:latest`

Follow the prompts to generate a root CA and server certificate.
```

The following files will be copied out of the container into your current working directory:

root.pem: your root CA; use for the `ssl_ca_path` in config.yml and with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` for BWDC/Bitwarden clients
certificate.crt: your server cert followed by the root CA in a bundle, use for `ssl_certificate_path`
server.pem: your server cert, not used for anything by default but may be required if using a separate load balancer or reverse-proxy
private.key: your server certificate's private key, use for `ssl_key_path`
